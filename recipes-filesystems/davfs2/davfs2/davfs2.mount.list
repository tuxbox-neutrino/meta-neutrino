# davfs2 Mount Configuration List
#
# This file contains a list of WebDAV shares to be mounted.
# Each line represents one mount point and follows the format:
# WebDAV-URL local_mount_point
#
# Replace 'WebDAV-URL' with the URL of the WebDAV share and
# 'local_mount_point' with the path where the WebDAV filesystem should be mounted.
# Example:
# https://example.com/webdav /mnt/webdav_example
# 
# You can add 'ignore_cert' in the third column to ignore certificates,
# but this is not recommended if you are not sure the server is reputable,
# but can be useful with self-generated certificates.
# Note: This is also just a hack, because mount.davfs may not work properly in this environment.
#
# Examples:
# https://example.com/webdav /mnt/webdav_example ignore_cert
# https://nextcloud.myserver.com/remote.php/dav/files/Username1 /mnt/dav1 ignore_cert
# https://nextcloud.myserver.com/remote.php/dav/files/Username1 /mnt/dav3
# https://owncloud.myserver.com/remote.php/dav/files/Username2 /mnt/dav4
# https://192.168.1.27:3443/remote.php/dav/files/demo /mnt/dav/my-cloud ignore_cert
